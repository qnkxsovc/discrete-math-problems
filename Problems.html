        <ul>
          <li>Prove the following identity: $$\sum_{i=0}^n {n \choose i} = 2^n$$ This is necessary to prove the efficiency of Binomial and Fibonnaci Heap datastructures. </li>
          <li>
            Consider a square grid. When the sides have even length, one can fill this grid using rectangular tiles, which are the size of two grid cells joined along a shared edge. Prove or disprove the following: when the square grid has two cells at opposing corners removed, one can fill the grid with rectangular tiles.</li>
          <li>
            Prove the following identity, and give an intuitive explanation for why it is true:
            $$\sum_{k=0}^n {r \choose k} {s \choose n-k } = {r + s \choose n}$$ 
            This is called Vandermonde's Convolution.
          </li>
          <li>
            Prove that if a prime number $p$ is the sum of two squares, then $p \equiv 1 \mod 4$. Then, prove that if a prime $p$ has $p \equiv 1 \mod 4$, then $p$ is the sum of two squares.
          </li>
          <li>
            A <i>hemisphere cap</i> is a covering that fits over exactly half of a sphere. Prove that any set of caps <i>which covers an entire sphere</i> must contain a subset of $4$ caps that cover the sphere.

            On the 4th floor, Snell Library has a row of chairs that people can sit in to study. 
            But no one wants a chair if there is another student in either of the adjacent chairs.
            Say students enter the library randomly, selecting any of the chairs that have no neighbors with equal likelihood.
            For a set of $n$ chairs, what is the expected number of chairs that are filled? What fraction of chairs are expected to be filled when $n$ goes to infinity?
          </li>

            You have three jars, filled with quantities $a$, $b$, $c$ of water. You are allowed to pour from a more full jug to a less full, and you must always double the amount of water in the smaller jug. So, an example pour could be $(a, b) \to (a-b, 2b)$ if $a > b$. The goal is to empty a jar, ie. pour $(a, b, c) \to (x, y, 0)$.

            - Working with only two of the jars, show that $(a, b) \to (x, 0)$ is only possible if $\frac{a + b}{\gcd(a, b)}$ is a power of two. 
            - Give an efficient algorithm to empty any set of three jars.
          </li>
          <li>
            Say that a graph has the property that all paths from a node $s$ to a node $t$ contains at least $\frac{\vert V \vert}{2} + 1$ edges. Prove that the graph contains a vertex $v$ so that all paths $s \to t$ contain $v$.
          </li>

          <li>
            Prove that for any undirected graph $G$, either $G$ or its complement must be connected.
          </li>

          <li>
            (untested) Define a generating function $\rho_t(z)$ whose coefficient on $z^n$ is probability of an event occurring $n$ times in an interval of $t$ time. Using the same ideas as Vandermonde's Convolution, recover the Poisson Distribution by solving the generating function for a closed form. (This will closely track the typical derivation of Poisson, as the binomial distribution with infinite samples).
          </li>

          <li>
            For any graph $G$ with $6$ vertices, show that either $G$ or its complement contains a three cycle.
          </li>
          <li>
            Given a set of $n$ items, make a selection of $n$ of them <i>with replacement</i>. What is the expected number of items that are never selected? As $n$ goes to infinity, what fraction of items are never selected?
